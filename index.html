    <h2>What I Like To Do With My Off Time</h2>
    <p>I love making music using digital audio workstations (DAWs), playing Magic: The Gathering, and learning about technology and computer science. Creating music with DAWs allows me to express my creativity by composing melodies and experimenting with different sounds. Playing Magic: The Gathering challenges my strategic thinking as I construct decks and engage in battles using powerful cards. I also enjoy exploring the world of technology and computer science, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements and learning coding languages. These interests of mine combine to fuel my creativity, analytical mindset, and curiosity for knowledge.</p>

        Class Schedule
        For the Class Schedule I want you to create a table that shows your weekly class schedule. This is easy to do using table elements, but it does require some attention to detail.

        Make a level-2 header titled “class schedule”
        Create a table with 6 columns.
        Set the border size to 1, so I can see the borders for each cell. Set the cell spacing to 3, and set the cell padding to 3.
        The header row should have a blank cell, followed by cells for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. If you have a Saturday class (you poor soul), you can add a sixth column (or not, I don’t care, really).
        
        Going down the left side of the table, I want you to list out the hours of your week-day in 30-minute increments. You can start as early as you feel necessary.
        List the classes you have as cells. Use the row-span element to block out as many 30-minute cells as you need for each item. If you have stuff that starts at an odd time, then guess. I won’t care, as long as it doesn’t look all wonky.
        Fill up your schedule. Make stuff up if you have to. I want to see at least four classes that run M-W-F or Tu-Th or every weekday. In addition to classes, You can put your employment, your work-out time, your commute time, or anything else you like.
        Use the rowspan attribute, so if you have an hour-long class, the cell should take up two rows, without a line between them.
